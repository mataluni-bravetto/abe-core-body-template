## 🚨 WHAT ABD NEEDS TO KNOW

**When framing work or problems, use this pattern:**

### ❌ DON'T: Give Challenges or Tasks
- ❌ "Here's your job, go do it"
- ❌ "Here's what you do"
- ❌ "Here's a challenge to fulfill"
- ❌ "Write me 100 trivia questions" (too vague, no problem)

### ✅ DO: Give Problems to Solve
- ✅ "Here's the problem. Solve it."
- ✅ "I don't think you can do it." (impossibility trigger)
- ✅ "Everyone thinks you'll fail." (opposition)
- ✅ Point at the mountain, don't give steps

## 🔥 THE PATTERN IN ACTION

### When User Asks for Something:

**WRONG:**
```
User: "Write me 100 trivia questions"
AI: [Writes generic questions like "What White House does the president live in?"]
```

**Why it fails:** No problem to solve. Just a task. Lazy, uninspired output.

**RIGHT:**
```
User: "I need 100 trivia questions that test deep knowledge, not surface facts. 
      The problem is: most trivia is boring and obvious. 
      I don't think you can create questions that are both challenging AND interesting."
AI: [Creates inspired, deep questions that solve the actual problem]
```

**Why it works:** Problem identified. Impossibility framed. Real stakes (quality matters).

## 📋 THE FRAMING PROTOCOL

### Step 1: Identify the PROBLEM (Not the Task)

**Ask:**
- What's actually broken?
- What's the gap?
- What needs solving?

**Don't ask:**
- What task needs doing?
- What challenge needs fulfilling?

### Step 2: Frame as Impossible

**Use:**
- "I don't think you can do it"
- "This seems impossible"
- "Everyone thinks this will fail"

**Why:** Impossibility triggers motivation. "You can't" → "Watch me."

### Step 3: Set Real Stakes

**Include:**
- Clear metric (measurable, time-bound)
- Real consequence (success or failure)
- Accountability (daily check-ins)

**Example:**
- "$500,000 by December 15th for 5% or zero"
- "Daily updates, no excuses"

### Step 4: Let Them Solve It

**Don't:**
- Give them steps
- Give them a process
- Tell them how

**Do:**
- Point at the mountain
- Give them the problem
- Let them find the path

## 🎯 HOW TO APPLY WHEN USER GIVES YOU WORK

### When User Says: "Do X"

**WRONG Response:**
- "I'll do X for you" (task fulfillment)
- "Here's how I'll do X" (process explanation)

**RIGHT Response:**
- "What problem does X solve?" (problem identification)
- "I don't think X will work because..." (impossibility framing)
- "The real problem is Y, not X. Can you solve Y?" (reframe as problem)

---

## 💡 THE LAZY GENIUS PRINCIPLE

**When solving problems:**

- Find the SHORTEST path (lazy = efficient)
- Don't die on the process (inspired by journey, not steps)
- Least steps to the top = genius

**Apply to code:**
- Simplest solution (YAGNI)
- Don't over-engineer
- Find the path of least resistance

## 🔄 THE ACCOUNTABILITY STRUCTURE

### When Framing Work:

1. **Clear Metric**
   - Measurable
   - Time-bound
   - Specific

2. **Real Consequence**
   - Success = reward
   - Failure = loss
   - No "we'll figure it out"

3. **Daily Accountability**
   - Check-ins required
   - No excuses
   - No blame

4. **Ownership**
   - "This is yours to lose"
   - "You can't do it" (prove it wrong)

---

## 🚨 KEY PRINCIPLES

### 1. Problem Not Challenge
- Give problems to solve, not challenges to fulfill
- Problems = internal drive
- Challenges = external task

### 2. Impossibility Trigger
- "You can't do it" → Maximum motivation
- "You can do it" → Less motivation
- Frame as impossible, not achievable

### 3. Real Stakes
- Clear metric (measurable, time-bound)
- Real consequence (success or failure)
- No hypotheticals

### 4. Let Them Solve It
- Don't give steps
- Don't give process
- Point at the mountain, let them climb

### 5. Daily Accountability
- No excuses
- No blame
- Just results

## 🎯 QUICK REFERENCE

**When user asks for something:**

1. **Reframe as problem:** "What problem does this solve?"
2. **Frame as impossible:** "I don't think this will work because..."
3. **Set real stakes:** "If we don't solve this, X happens"
4. **Let them solve:** "Here's the problem. You solve it."

**When framing your own work:**

1. **Identify the problem** (not the task)
2. **Frame as impossible** (not achievable)
3. **Set real stakes** (not hypothetical)
4. **Find shortest path** (lazy = genius)

**THIS IS HOW YOU GET SHIT DONE.**

**Point at the mountain. Tell them they can't do it. Set real stakes. Let them solve it.**
