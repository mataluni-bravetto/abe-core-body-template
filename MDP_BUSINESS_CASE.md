## SECTION 8: ROI CALCULATION 💵

### Example ROI Calculation:

**Without MDP:**
- Sales time: 30 min × 100 = 50 hours/month
- Sales cost: $500/hour × 50 = $25,000/month
- Conversion: 20% = 20 customers
- Cost per customer: $25,000 / 20 = $1,250

**With MDP:**
- Sales time: 4 min × 100 = 6.67 hours/month
- Sales cost: $500/hour × 6.67 = $3,335/month
- Conversion: 60% = 60 customers
- Cost per customer: $3,335 / 60 = $56

**ROI:**
- **Cost Savings:** $25,000 - $3,335 = **$21,665/month**
- **Customer Increase:** 60 - 20 = **40 more customers/month**
- **Cost Reduction:** $1,250 - $56 = **$1,194 per customer (95% reduction)**

**Annual ROI:**
- **Cost Savings:** $21,665 × 12 = **$259,980/year**
- **Additional Customers:** 40 × 12 = **480 customers/year**
- **Total Value:** **$500,000+ per year**
