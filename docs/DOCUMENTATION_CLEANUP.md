### Duplicates Removed

Removed duplicate files from root (already exist in docs/):

- CODEBASE_REVIEW_REPORT.md (exists in docs/reports/)
- ERROR_HANDLING_OVERVIEW.md (exists in docs/technical/)
- FINAL_REVIEW_SUMMARY.md (exists in docs/reports/)
- FRONTEND_READINESS_ASSESSMENT.md (exists in docs/reports/)
- ISSUE_VERIFICATION_REPORT.md (exists in docs/reports/)
- MINOR_ISSUES_FIXES_SUMMARY.md (exists in docs/reports/)
- TECH_DEBT_ANALYSIS.md (exists in docs/technical/)
- TECH_DEBT_FIXES_COMPLETE.md (exists in docs/technical/)

### Root Directory Cleanup

**Remaining files in root:**
- README.md (main project README - should stay)
- plan.plan.md (project plan - keep for reference)
- aiagentsuitbible.md (may need to be moved to docs/features/)
